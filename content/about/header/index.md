I graduated from Central European University's Master of Political Science degree in June 2021. I previously worked as an intern and research assistant at the Issam Fares Institute, the Center for Foreign Policy and Peace Research, Bilkent University, and the Istanbul Policy Center. I'm looking for a role that will allow me to gain further research experience and prepare me for a PhD in political science.
